# UFOs

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to design a webpage to provide a detailed analysis of UFO sightings
by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.

This will involve using date, city, state, country and state filters by replacing the handle click function 
with a new function that saves the element, value, and id of the filter that was changed.

A new function will be created to loop through the dataset and keep only the results that match the search criteria after pressing enter.

### Resources

**Data Sources:** data.js, ufo_starterCode.js

**Code Files:** app.js, index.html

**Software:** Visual Studio Code 1.56.0, jupyter Notebook 6.3.0, ES6, Javascript, HTML, Bootstrap, CSS.

## Project Results

This section presents the result of the project using images and a brief description of the result.

###  Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria

The below image shows the filter criteria;

The placeholder values for the date, city, state, country and shape labels are 1/10/2010, naples, ca, us and sphere respectively.

The webpage users can filter using the filter search by inputing any search of their choice.

Take for example a user who wants to get information on el cajon state. All the user needs to do is to key-in "el cajon"
in the enter city dialog box.

See image below;

Same methodology can be used in searching for other city or even multiple criteria by combining different search criterias.

## Project Summary

The webpage might not look as flashy and unique as we would like it to be. However, it delivers on the purpose for which it was designed for.

One major drawback of the webpage is that it unable to be resized when viewed certain devices. 

There are several potentials for further development. The following recommendations are ways in which the webpage can be improved on;

Firstly, we can add formatting that will readjust the margins to address the sizing issues identified above.

Secondly, the filter criteria can be expanded instead of being limited to five criteria used in the webpage.

Finally, the table can be expanded to include a wider array of information.
